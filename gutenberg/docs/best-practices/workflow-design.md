# Workflow Design Best Practices

## Overview

Effective workflow design is crucial for creating maintainable, efficient, and reliable multi-agent orchestrations. This guide provides proven best practices for designing workflows that maximize agent capabilities while minimizing complexity and potential failure points.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle

Each workflow phase should have a single, well-defined responsibility.

**Good Example:**
```markdown
## Phase 1: API Design
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="api-designer"
- Prompt: "Design RESTful API endpoints for user management system"
- Output: API specification document
```

**Poor Example:**
```markdown
## Phase 1: Everything Setup
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="full-stack-developer"
- Prompt: "Design API, implement database, create frontend, and deploy to production"
- Output: Complete application
```

### 2. Clear Input/Output Contracts

Define explicit contracts for what each phase expects as input and produces as output.

**Best Practice:**
```markdown
## Phase 2: Database Implementation
- **Input Required**: API specification from Phase 1
- **Agent**: database-architect
- **Output**: Database schema, migration scripts, data access layer
- **Context for Next Phase**: Database connection details, schema documentation
```

### 3. Loose Coupling Between Phases

Minimize dependencies between phases to improve maintainability and enable parallel execution where possible.

**Design Pattern:**
```markdown
# Instead of tight coupling:
Phase A → Phase B → Phase C (each depends on previous)

# Prefer loose coupling:
Phase A → Shared Context → Phase B
Phase A → Shared Context → Phase C (B and C can run in parallel)
```

## Workflow Structure Best Practices

### 1. Logical Phase Organization

Group related tasks into coherent phases that represent meaningful milestones.

```markdown
## Recommended Phase Structure:

### Analysis Phase
- Requirements gathering
- Feasibility assessment
- Risk analysis

### Design Phase
- Architecture design
- Interface specification
- Technology selection

### Implementation Phase
- Core development
- Integration work
- Testing

### Deployment Phase
- Environment setup
- Deployment execution
- Monitoring configuration
```

### 2. Appropriate Granularity

Balance between too many small phases (overhead) and too few large phases (lack of control).

**Guidelines:**
- **Too Granular**: 15+ phases for a simple web application
- **Too Coarse**: 2 phases for a complex enterprise system
- **Just Right**: 4-8 phases for most workflows

### 3. Clear Phase Boundaries

Each phase should have clear entry and exit criteria.

```markdown
## Phase 3: Implementation
- **Entry Criteria**: Approved design document, technology stack selected
- **Exit Criteria**: Code complete, unit tests passing, integration tests successful
- **Quality Gates**: Code review completed, security scan passed
```

## Agent Selection Best Practices

### 1. Match Agent Expertise to Task Requirements

Choose agents whose specializations align closely with task requirements.

```markdown
# Good agent selection:
## Phase: Payment Integration
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="payment-specialist"
- Rationale: Specialized knowledge of payment processing, PCI compliance

# Poor agent selection:
## Phase: Payment Integration  
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="general-developer"
- Problem: Lacks specialized payment processing expertise
```

### 2. Consider Agent Model Requirements

Match task complexity to appropriate agent model capabilities.

**Model Selection Guidelines:**
- **Opus**: Complex analysis, architecture decisions, creative problem-solving
- **Sonnet**: Standard development tasks, implementation work, integration
- **Haiku**: Simple, well-defined tasks, validation, formatting

### 3. Provide Fallback Agents

Always specify alternative agents for critical phases.

```markdown
## Phase 2: Security Assessment
- **Primary Agent**: security-auditor (opus)
- **Fallback Agent**: security-engineer (sonnet)
- **Rationale**: Ensures phase completion even if primary agent unavailable
```

## Context Management Best Practices

### 1. Context Minimization

Pass only necessary information between phases to avoid context bloat.

**Good Practice:**
```markdown
## Phase 2: Frontend Development
- Context from Phase 1: API endpoints, authentication scheme, data models
- Excluded: Internal implementation details, database connection strings
```

**Poor Practice:**
```markdown
## Phase 2: Frontend Development
- Context from Phase 1: [Entire Phase 1 output including internal details, debug logs, temporary files]
```

### 2. Context Validation

Validate context at phase boundaries to catch issues early.

```markdown
## Phase 3: Testing
- **Context Validation**:
  - Verify API endpoints are accessible
  - Confirm test data is available
  - Validate environment configuration
- **Proceed Only If**: All validations pass
```

### 3. Context Transformation

Transform context appropriately for different agents and phases.

```python
# Example context transformation
def transform_context_for_testing(implementation_context):
    return {
        'api_endpoints': implementation_context['endpoints'],
        'test_data_location': implementation_context['sample_data'],
        'environment_config': implementation_context['config'],
        # Exclude: source code, build artifacts, internal details
    }
```

## Error Handling Best Practices

### 1. Anticipate Common Failure Points

Design workflows with awareness of likely failure scenarios.

**Common Failure Points:**
- Agent unavailability
- Context validation failures
- External service dependencies
- Resource constraints
- Integration conflicts

### 2. Implement Graceful Degradation

Design workflows to continue functioning with reduced capability when components fail.

```markdown
## Phase 4: Performance Testing
- **Primary Approach**: Comprehensive load testing with performance-tester
- **Degraded Approach**: Basic performance validation with general-tester
- **Trigger**: If performance-tester unavailable or performance testing tools inaccessible
```

### 3. Provide Clear Error Recovery

Define specific recovery procedures for different error scenarios.

```markdown
## Error Recovery Procedures:

### Agent Failure:
1. Retry with same agent (max 2 attempts)
2. Switch to fallback agent
3. Escalate to manual intervention

### Context Validation Failure:
1. Attempt context repair
2. Request context regeneration from previous phase
3. Use default/minimal context if safe

### Integration Failure:
1. Verify external dependencies
2. Retry with exponential backoff
3. Switch to alternative integration approach
```

## Performance Optimization Best Practices

### 1. Identify Parallelization Opportunities

Look for tasks that can be executed concurrently to reduce overall execution time.

```markdown
# Sequential (slower):
Phase 1: API Development → Phase 2: Frontend → Phase 3: Mobile → Phase 4: Testing

# Parallel (faster):
Phase 1: API Development → Phase 2: Parallel Development
  ├── Branch A: Frontend Development
  ├── Branch B: Mobile Development
  └── Branch C: Documentation
→ Phase 3: Integration Testing
```

### 2. Optimize Context Size

Keep context size manageable to avoid performance degradation.

**Context Size Guidelines:**
- **Small**: < 1MB (optimal)
- **Medium**: 1-5MB (acceptable)
- **Large**: 5-10MB (requires optimization)
- **Too Large**: > 10MB (must be reduced)

**Optimization Techniques:**
- Summarize verbose outputs
- Reference external artifacts instead of embedding
- Compress large data structures
- Remove redundant information

### 3. Cache Expensive Operations

Cache results of expensive operations that might be reused.

```python
# Example caching strategy
class WorkflowCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agent_analysis_cache = {}
        self.context_validation_cache = {}
    
    def cache_agent_analysis(self, requirements_hash, analysis_result):
        self.agent_analysis_cache[requirements_hash] = analysis_result
    
    def get_cached_analysis(self, requirements_hash):
        return self.agent_analysis_cache.get(requirements_hash)
```

## Quality Assurance Best Practices

### 1. Implement Validation Checkpoints

Add validation points throughout the workflow to catch issues early.

```markdown
## Validation Checkpoints:

### After Phase 1 (Design):
- Architecture review checklist
- Stakeholder approval
- Technical feasibility confirmation

### After Phase 2 (Implementation):
- Code quality metrics
- Security scan results
- Performance benchmarks

### Before Phase 3 (Deployment):
- Integration test results
- User acceptance criteria
- Deployment readiness checklist
```

### 2. Define Success Criteria

Establish clear, measurable success criteria for each phase and the overall workflow.

```markdown
## Success Criteria:

### Phase-Level:
- Code coverage > 80%
- Security scan: 0 critical vulnerabilities
- Performance: Response time < 200ms

### Workflow-Level:
- All phases completed successfully
- Stakeholder acceptance achieved
- Production deployment successful
- Post-deployment monitoring stable
```

### 3. Implement Continuous Monitoring

Monitor workflow execution and outcomes to identify improvement opportunities.

```python
# Example monitoring implementation
class WorkflowMonitor:
    def track_phase_completion(self, phase_name, duration, success):
        metrics = {
            'phase': phase_name,
            'duration': duration,
            'success': success,
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow()
        }
        self.log_metrics(metrics)
    
    def analyze_workflow_patterns(self):
        # Analyze execution patterns
        # Identify bottlenecks
        # Suggest optimizations
        pass
```

## Documentation Best Practices

### 1. Comprehensive Workflow Documentation

Document workflows thoroughly for maintainability and knowledge transfer.

**Required Documentation:**
- Workflow purpose and objectives
- Phase descriptions and responsibilities
- Agent selection rationale
- Context flow diagrams
- Error handling procedures
- Success criteria and validation

### 2. Decision Rationale

Document the reasoning behind key design decisions.

```markdown
## Design Decisions:

### Agent Selection:
- **Decision**: Use payment-specialist for payment integration
- **Rationale**: Specialized expertise in PCI compliance and payment processing
- **Alternatives Considered**: general-developer, security-specialist
- **Trade-offs**: Higher specialization vs. availability

### Pattern Selection:
- **Decision**: Hybrid workflow with sequential foundation and parallel implementation
- **Rationale**: Foundation requires sequential dependency, implementation can be parallelized
- **Performance Impact**: 40% reduction in execution time vs. pure sequential
```

### 3. Maintenance Guidelines

Provide clear guidelines for workflow maintenance and updates.

```markdown
## Maintenance Guidelines:

### Regular Reviews:
- Monthly performance analysis
- Quarterly agent effectiveness review
- Semi-annual workflow optimization

### Update Procedures:
1. Test changes in development environment
2. Validate with subset of use cases
3. Gradual rollout with monitoring
4. Rollback plan if issues detected

### Version Control:
- Semantic versioning for workflow definitions
- Change log with impact analysis
- Backward compatibility considerations
```

## Testing Best Practices

### 1. Workflow Testing Strategy

Implement comprehensive testing at multiple levels.

**Testing Levels:**
- **Unit Testing**: Individual phase logic
- **Integration Testing**: Phase-to-phase interactions
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete workflow execution
- **Performance Testing**: Execution time and resource usage
- **Failure Testing**: Error handling and recovery

### 2. Test Data Management

Maintain appropriate test data for workflow validation.

```markdown
## Test Data Strategy:

### Synthetic Data:
- Generated test cases covering edge cases
- Consistent data for repeatable tests
- Privacy-compliant test scenarios

### Production-Like Data:
- Anonymized production data samples
- Realistic data volumes and complexity
- Representative use case coverage
```

### 3. Automated Testing

Automate workflow testing to ensure consistent quality.

```python
# Example automated testing framework
class WorkflowTestSuite:
    def test_workflow_execution(self):
        # Test complete workflow execution
        result = self.execute_workflow(self.test_requirements)
        assert result.success
        assert result.meets_success_criteria()
    
    def test_error_handling(self):
        # Test error scenarios
        with self.simulate_agent_failure('backend-developer'):
            result = self.execute_workflow(self.test_requirements)
            assert result.used_fallback_agent
            assert result.success
    
    def test_performance(self):
        # Test performance requirements
        start_time = time.time()
        result = self.execute_workflow(self.test_requirements)
        execution_time = time.time() - start_time
        assert execution_time < self.max_execution_time
```

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. God Phases

Avoid phases that try to do too much.

**Anti-Pattern:**
```markdown
## Phase 1: Complete Application Development
- Design architecture
- Implement backend
- Create frontend
- Set up database
- Deploy to production
- Configure monitoring
```

**Better Approach:**
```markdown
## Phase 1: Architecture Design
## Phase 2: Backend Implementation  
## Phase 3: Frontend Development
## Phase 4: Integration & Testing
## Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring
```

### 2. Context Pollution

Avoid passing unnecessary or sensitive information between phases.

**Anti-Pattern:**
```markdown
Context passed to frontend phase:
- Database connection strings
- Internal API keys
- Debug logs
- Temporary files
- Backend implementation details
```

**Better Approach:**
```markdown
Context passed to frontend phase:
- Public API endpoints
- Authentication configuration
- UI/UX requirements
- Integration specifications
```

### 3. Rigid Error Handling

Avoid workflows that fail completely on any error.

**Anti-Pattern:**
```markdown
If any phase fails → Entire workflow fails → Manual intervention required
```

**Better Approach:**
```markdown
Phase failure → Try fallback agent → Try alternative approach → Graceful degradation → Manual intervention only if all options exhausted
```
