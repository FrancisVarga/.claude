# Parallel Workflows

## Overview

Parallel workflows enable concurrent execution of independent tasks, maximizing resource utilization and reducing overall execution time. This pattern is ideal when multiple tasks can be performed simultaneously without dependencies, allowing for efficient multi-agent coordination.

## Pattern Characteristics

### Core Properties

- **Concurrent Execution**: Multiple tasks run simultaneously
- **Independence**: Tasks don't depend on each other's intermediate results
- **Resource Optimization**: Better utilization of available agents and compute resources
- **Result Aggregation**: Outputs are combined after parallel execution
- **Scalability**: Performance improves with additional resources

```

## When to Use Parallel Workflows

### Ideal Use Cases

1. **Independent Task Execution**
   - Multi-platform development (web, mobile, desktop simultaneously)
   - Parallel testing across different environments
   - Independent feature development by different teams

2. **Resource-Intensive Operations**
   - Data processing across multiple datasets
   - Parallel analysis of different aspects of a system
   - Concurrent quality assurance activities

3. **Time-Critical Projects**
   - Rapid prototyping with multiple approaches
   - Emergency response with parallel investigation tracks
   - Competitive analysis across multiple dimensions

### Pattern Selection Criteria

Choose parallel workflows when:
- Tasks are truly independent
- Resources are available for concurrent execution
- Time optimization is critical
- Results can be meaningfully aggregated
- Failure of one branch doesn't invalidate others

## Parallel Workflow Template

### Basic Template Structure

```markdown
[Extended thinking: Parallel workflow for {purpose}. Independent tasks executed simultaneously with result aggregation and conflict resolution.]

## Phase 1: Preparation & Distribution
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="{coordinator-agent}"
- Prompt: "Prepare shared context and distribute work across parallel branches: {task distribution}"
- Output: Shared context, task assignments, coordination parameters
- Context for parallel phases: {Common baseline information}

## Phase 2: Parallel Execution

### Branch A: {Task A Name}
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="{agent-a}"
- Prompt: "Execute {Task A} using shared context: [baseline information]. Focus on {specific aspect A}."
- Output: {Task A deliverables}
- Dependencies: {Minimal shared context only}

### Branch B: {Task B Name}
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="{agent-b}"
- Prompt: "Execute {Task B} using shared context: [baseline information]. Focus on {specific aspect B}."
- Output: {Task B deliverables}
- Dependencies: {Minimal shared context only}

### Branch C: {Task C Name}
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="{agent-c}"
- Prompt: "Execute {Task C} using shared context: [baseline information]. Focus on {specific aspect C}."
- Output: {Task C deliverables}
- Dependencies: {Minimal shared context only}

## Phase 3: Result Aggregation & Integration
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="{integration-agent}"
- Prompt: "Integrate results from parallel branches: [Branch A results], [Branch B results], [Branch C results]. Resolve conflicts and create unified output."
- Output: {Integrated deliverables}
- Final context: {Comprehensive results from all branches}

## Best Practices

### Design Guidelines

1. **Ensure True Independence**
   - Verify that branches don't have hidden dependencies
   - Use shared context only for initial setup
   - Avoid inter-branch communication during execution

2. **Resource Management**
   - Monitor resource utilization across branches
   - Implement load balancing for optimal performance
   - Plan for resource contention scenarios

3. **Result Integration**
   - Design clear aggregation strategies
   - Handle conflicting results gracefully
   - Validate integrated outputs

4. **Error Resilience**
   - Implement partial failure handling
   - Provide retry mechanisms for failed branches
   - Design graceful degradation strategies

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Hidden Dependencies**
   - Branches that secretly depend on each other's results
   - Shared mutable state between branches
   - Race conditions in resource access

2. **Poor Resource Planning**
   - Oversubscribing available resources
   - Ignoring resource contention
   - Inadequate load balancing

3. **Ineffective Aggregation**
   - Losing important information during result merging
   - Poor conflict resolution strategies
   - Inadequate validation of integrated results

## Conclusion

Parallel workflows provide significant performance benefits when tasks can be executed independently. They enable efficient resource utilization and faster completion times, making them ideal for scenarios where multiple aspects of a problem can be addressed simultaneously.

Key advantages:
- **Improved performance through concurrency**
- **Better resource utilization**
- **Scalability with additional resources**
- **Fault tolerance through partial execution**

Use parallel workflows when you have independent tasks that can benefit from concurrent execution and when you have sufficient resources to support parallel processing.
