- Reduce parallel branches in development phases

### For Enterprise E-commerce
- Add additional conditional paths for different markets
- Include more sophisticated recommendation engines
- Add advanced analytics and reporting
- Implement multi-tenant architecture
- Add B2B-specific features

### For Mobile-First E-commerce
- Start with mobile app development instead of web
- Add native mobile payment integrations

## Conclusion

This e-commerce workflow example demonstrates the power of the hybrid coordination pattern for complex, multi-faceted projects. The combination of sequential foundation building, conditional decision-making, and parallel development enabled the delivery of a comprehensive e-commerce platform that exceeded performance targets while maintaining high quality and security standards.

The workflow's success was driven by:
