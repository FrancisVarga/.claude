# Workflow Pattern Analysis

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of workflow coordination patterns used in multi-agent orchestration. Understanding these patterns is crucial for creating efficient, maintainable workflows that maximize agent capabilities.

## Core Workflow Patterns

### 1. Sequential Workflows

Sequential workflows represent linear task progression where each phase depends on the previous one.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Phase 1] --> B[Phase 2] --> C[Phase 3] --> D[Phase 4] --> E[Result]
```

#### Characteristics
- **Linear Dependency**: Each phase requires completion of the previous phase
- **Context Accumulation**: Information builds progressively through phases
- **Simple Error Handling**: Failures can be handled at each phase
- **Predictable Execution**: Clear, deterministic flow

#### Use Cases
- Step-by-step processes (e.g., build → test → deploy)
- Data transformation pipelines
- Approval workflows
- Progressive enhancement scenarios

#### Example Pattern
```markdown
## Phase 1: Foundation
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="architect"
- Output: Architecture design
- Context for next: Design specifications

## Phase 2: Implementation
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="developer"
- Input: Architecture from Phase 1
- Output: Implementation code
- Context accumulation: Design + Code
```

### 2. Parallel Workflows

Parallel workflows enable concurrent execution of independent tasks, improving efficiency.

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Initial Phase] --> B[Parallel Branch A]
    A --> C[Parallel Branch B]
    A --> D[Parallel Branch C]
    B --> E[Aggregation Phase]
    C --> E
    D --> E
    E --> F[Result]
```

#### Characteristics
- **Independent Execution**: Branches run concurrently
- **Resource Optimization**: Better utilization of available agents
- **Complex Synchronization**: Requires careful result aggregation
- **Performance Benefits**: Reduced overall execution time

#### Use Cases
- Multi-platform development (web + mobile + API)
- Independent feature implementation
- Parallel quality checks (testing + security + performance)
- Distributed data processing

#### Example Pattern
```markdown
## Phase 1: Parallel Development
### Branch A: Frontend
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="frontend-developer"
- Independent execution

### Branch B: Backend
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="backend-developer"
- Independent execution

### Branch C: Mobile
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="mobile-developer"
- Independent execution

## Phase 2: Integration
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="integration-engineer"
- Aggregate results from all branches
```

### 3. Conditional Workflows

Conditional workflows implement decision-based branching for dynamic execution paths.

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Analysis Phase] --> B{Decision Point}
    B -->|Condition A| C[Path A]
    B -->|Condition B| D[Path B]
    B -->|Condition C| E[Path C]
    C --> F[Convergence]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G[Result]
```

#### Characteristics
- **Dynamic Path Selection**: Runtime decision making
- **Flexible Execution**: Adapts to different scenarios
- **Complex Logic**: Requires clear decision criteria
- **Fallback Support**: Can include default paths

#### Use Cases
- Technology selection (AWS vs Azure vs GCP)
- Payment processing (Stripe vs PayPal)
- Deployment strategies (blue-green vs canary)
- Error recovery paths

#### Example Pattern
```markdown
## Phase 1: Analysis
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="analyst"
- Output: Recommendation and criteria

## Phase 2: Conditional Implementation
### If Condition: Cloud Provider = AWS
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="aws-specialist"

### Elif Condition: Cloud Provider = Azure
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="azure-specialist"

### Else: Default to GCP
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="gcp-specialist"
```

### 4. Hybrid Workflows

Hybrid workflows combine multiple patterns for complex orchestration scenarios.

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Sequential Start] --> B[Phase 1]
    B --> C{Conditional Branch}
    C -->|Path 1| D[Sequential Steps]
    C -->|Path 2| E[Parallel Execution]
    D --> F[Convergence]
    E --> G[Sub-branch 1]
    E --> H[Sub-branch 2]
    G --> F
    H --> F
    F --> I[Final Phase]
```

#### Characteristics
- **Maximum Flexibility**: Combines all pattern types
- **Complex Coordination**: Requires sophisticated management
- **Optimal Efficiency**: Uses best pattern for each phase
- **Challenging Design**: Needs careful planning

#### Use Cases
- Full application development lifecycle
- Complex data processing pipelines
- Multi-stage deployment processes
- Enterprise integration scenarios

## Pattern Selection Criteria

### Decision Matrix

| Criteria | Sequential | Parallel | Conditional | Hybrid |
|----------|------------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Task Dependencies | High | Low | Medium | Variable |
| Execution Speed | Slower | Faster | Medium | Optimized |
| Complexity | Low | Medium | Medium | High |
| Error Handling | Simple | Complex | Medium | Complex |
| Resource Usage | Low | High | Medium | Variable |
| Flexibility | Low | Medium | High | Maximum |

### Selection Guidelines

1. **Use Sequential When:**
   - Tasks have strict dependencies
   - Context must flow linearly
   - Simple, predictable process
   - Order is critical

2. **Use Parallel When:**
   - Tasks are independent
   - Performance is critical
   - Resources are available
   - Results can be aggregated

3. **Use Conditional When:**
   - Multiple valid approaches exist
   - Runtime decisions needed
   - Different scenarios require different handling
   - Flexibility is important

4. **Use Hybrid When:**
   - Complex requirements
   - Multiple patterns needed
   - Optimization is critical
   - Full orchestration control required

## Context Management Strategies

### Sequential Context Flow
```python
context = {}
for phase in workflow.phases:
    phase_result = execute_phase(phase, context)
    context.update(phase_result)
```

### Parallel Context Isolation
```python
base_context = prepare_base_context()
results = parallel_execute([
    (branch_a, base_context.copy()),
    (branch_b, base_context.copy()),
    (branch_c, base_context.copy())
])
merged_context = merge_results(results)
```

### Conditional Context Branching
```python
analysis_context = analyze_requirements()
if analysis_context['condition'] == 'A':
    context = execute_path_a(analysis_context)
elif analysis_context['condition'] == 'B':
    context = execute_path_b(analysis_context)
else:
    context = execute_default_path(analysis_context)
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Execution Time Analysis

| Pattern | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
|---------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Sequential | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) |
| Parallel | O(1) | O(log n) | O(n) |
| Conditional | O(1) | O(n/2) | O(n) |
| Hybrid | O(1) | O(√n) | O(n) |

Where n = number of tasks/phases

### Resource Utilization

1. **Sequential**: Minimal resource usage, one agent at a time
2. **Parallel**: Maximum resource usage, multiple concurrent agents
3. **Conditional**: Variable usage based on path selection
4. **Hybrid**: Optimized usage based on phase requirements

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Unnecessary Parallelization
- Don't parallelize dependent tasks
- Avoid parallel execution for trivial tasks
- Consider overhead vs benefits

### 2. Over-Complex Conditionals
- Limit decision tree depth
- Avoid nested conditionals beyond 3 levels
- Provide clear default paths

### 3. Context Pollution
- Don't pass unnecessary context
- Avoid mutable shared state in parallel branches
- Clean up context between phases

### 4. Pattern Misuse
- Don't use hybrid for simple workflows
- Avoid sequential for independent tasks
- Don't force patterns where they don't fit

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Pattern Combination
```markdown
## Optimized Hybrid Example
Phase 1: Sequential analysis
Phase 2: Conditional technology selection
Phase 3: Parallel implementation
Phase 4: Sequential integration
```

### 2. Dynamic Pattern Selection
```python
def select_pattern(requirements):
    if has_dependencies(requirements):
        if has_alternatives(requirements):
            return 'hybrid'
        return 'sequential'
    elif can_parallelize(requirements):
        return 'parallel'
    else:
        return 'conditional'
```
