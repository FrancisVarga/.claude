# Agent Format Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the structure and format of agents in our ecosystem, providing insights into how agents are defined, their capabilities, and how they integrate with the workflow creator.

## Agent Definition Structure

### Frontmatter Format

Every agent is defined using a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: agent-identifier
description: Brief description of agent's purpose and capabilities
model: opus|sonnet|haiku  # Model requirement based on complexity
---
```

### Key Components

1. **Name**: Unique identifier using kebab-case (e.g., `backend-architect`, `test-automator`)
2. **Description**: Concise summary of agent's specialization and capabilities
3. **Model**: Specifies the required LLM model based on task complexity:
   - **opus**: Complex analysis, architecture, and design tasks
   - **sonnet**: Standard development and implementation tasks
   - **haiku**: Simple, well-defined tasks with clear patterns

## Agent Capability Patterns

### Common Capability Categories

Through analysis of 40+ agents, we've identified these primary capability categories:

#### 1. **Architecture & Design Agents**
- Focus on system design and architectural decisions
- Examples: `backend-architect`, `cloud-architect`, `api-designer`
- Typically require `opus` model for complex reasoning

#### 2. **Implementation Agents**
- Handle code generation and feature implementation
- Examples: `frontend-developer`, `mobile-developer`, `backend-developer`
- Usually use `sonnet` model for balanced performance

#### 3. **Quality Assurance Agents**
- Ensure code quality, testing, and security
- Examples: `test-automator`, `security-auditor`, `code-reviewer`
- Model varies based on analysis depth required

#### 4. **Specialized Integration Agents**
- Handle specific technologies or integrations
- Examples: `payment-integration`, `database-specialist`, `devops-engineer`
- Model selection based on integration complexity

## Agent Description Patterns

### Effective Description Structure

```markdown
You are an expert [specialization] focusing on [primary domain].
Your role involves [key responsibilities] with emphasis on [quality attributes].

## Core Capabilities
- [Capability 1]: Detailed description
- [Capability 2]: Detailed description
- [Capability 3]: Detailed description

## Focus Areas
- [Area 1]: Specific expertise
- [Area 2]: Specific expertise
- [Area 3]: Specific expertise

## Output Standards
- [Standard 1]: Expected deliverable format
- [Standard 2]: Quality criteria
- [Standard 3]: Integration requirements
```

### Semantic Markers for Capability Detection

The workflow creator uses these patterns to identify agent capabilities:

1. **Action Verbs**: "design", "implement", "analyze", "optimize", "integrate"
2. **Domain Keywords**: "API", "frontend", "backend", "mobile", "security", "testing"
3. **Technology Mentions**: Specific frameworks, languages, or tools
4. **Quality Attributes**: "scalable", "secure", "performant", "maintainable"

## Agent Capability Extraction

### Pattern-Based Extraction

```python
capability_patterns = [
    r'## Focus Areas\s*\n(.*?)(?=\n##|\n---|\Z)',
    r'## Core Responsibilities\s*\n(.*?)(?=\n##|\n---|\Z)',
    r'## Capabilities\s*\n(.*?)(?=\n##|\n---|\Z)',
    r'- (.*?)(?=\n-|\n\n|\Z)'
]
```

### Semantic Analysis

The workflow creator performs semantic analysis to:
1. Extract implicit capabilities from descriptions
2. Identify technology stack expertise
3. Determine integration compatibility
4. Assess task complexity alignment

## Agent Compatibility Matrix

### Model Compatibility

| Agent Type | Opus | Sonnet | Haiku |
|------------|------|--------|-------|
| Architecture & Design | ✅ Primary | ✅ Capable | ❌ Limited |
| Implementation | ✅ Overkill | ✅ Primary | ✅ Simple tasks |
| Quality Assurance | ✅ Deep analysis | ✅ Standard | ✅ Basic checks |
| Integration | ✅ Complex | ✅ Standard | ✅ Simple |

### Inter-Agent Compatibility

Agents work best together when:
1. **Complementary Skills**: Frontend + Backend + Database
2. **Shared Context**: Similar domain understanding
3. **Compatible Output**: Standardized formats for handoffs
4. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined responsibilities

## Best Practices for Agent Definition

### 1. Clear Specialization
- Define a specific, focused area of expertise
- Avoid overlapping responsibilities with other agents
- Maintain clear boundaries

### 2. Comprehensive Capabilities
- List all major capabilities explicitly
- Include both technical and soft skills
- Specify output formats and standards

### 3. Semantic Richness
- Use descriptive action verbs
- Include relevant domain keywords
- Mention specific technologies
- Describe quality attributes

### 4. Integration Readiness
- Define input/output formats
- Specify context requirements
- Include error handling approaches
- Document dependencies

## Agent Discovery Optimization

### Indexing Strategy

```python
class AgentIndex:
    def __init__(self):
        self.capability_index = {}  # capability -> [agents]
        self.technology_index = {}  # technology -> [agents]
        self.domain_index = {}      # domain -> [agents]
        self.model_index = {}       # model -> [agents]
```

### Search Optimization

1. **Primary Index**: Capability-based matching
2. **Secondary Index**: Technology stack alignment
3. **Tertiary Index**: Domain expertise
4. **Quaternary Index**: Model requirements

## Validation Checklist

When defining a new agent, ensure:

- [ ] Unique, descriptive name in kebab-case
- [ ] Clear, concise description in frontmatter
- [ ] Appropriate model selection
- [ ] Comprehensive capability listing
- [ ] Specific focus areas defined
- [ ] Output standards documented
- [ ] Integration points clarified
- [ ] Error handling mentioned
- [ ] Dependencies specified

## Future Enhancements

### Proposed Improvements

1. **Capability Scoring**: Quantitative capability assessment
2. **Performance Metrics**: Historical execution data
3. **Compatibility Scoring**: Inter-agent compatibility ratings
4. **Dynamic Model Selection**: Task-based model optimization
5. **Capability Evolution**: Learning from execution patterns

### Metadata Extensions

## Conclusion

Understanding agent format and structure is crucial for:
- Effective agent selection in workflows
- Proper task-agent matching
- Optimal workflow generation
- System scalability and maintenance

The standardized format ensures consistency while allowing flexibility for specialized agents. The workflow creator leverages this structure to dynamically match tasks with the most suitable agents, creating efficient multi-agent workflows.
