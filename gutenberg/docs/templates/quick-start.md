```

## Step 2: Choose Your Workflow Pattern

Select the most appropriate workflow pattern based on your requirements.

### Pattern Selection Guide

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Tasks have dependencies?}
    B -->|Yes| C{Dependencies are linear?}
    B -->|No| D[Parallel Workflow]
    
    C -->|Yes| E[Sequential Workflow]
    C -->|No| F{Multiple valid approaches?}
    
    F -->|Yes| G[Conditional Workflow]
    F -->|No| H[Hybrid Workflow]
    
    D --> I[Use Parallel Pattern]
    E --> J[Use Sequential Pattern]
    G --> K[Use Conditional Pattern]
    H --> L[Use Hybrid Pattern]
```

### Pattern Recommendations

**For our task management example:**
- **Foundation**: Sequential (architecture → implementation)
- **Development**: Parallel (frontend + backend + database)
- **Integration**: Sequential (testing → deployment)
- **Result**: Hybrid workflow combining sequential and parallel patterns

## Step 3: Create Your Workflow

Use the Workflow Creator Agent to generate your workflow.

### Basic Workflow Request

```markdown
